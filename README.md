# singleDayCalendar
This is a single day calendar, dynamically created in JavaScript,
 


Using this daily planner, you can save notes on an 8am-6pm schedule.
(Timeblocks are valued with the start of each hour 8am-5pm)

At the top of the screen you will see todays date and the current hour

Each time block is dynamically created and then,
 color coded based on the current time versus
 the time vlaue of that block.

When the time is one hour past that value, 
  the timeblock is no longer able to be edited.

Just click on each block to type in notes or events,
 and then click the save button. 

Need to close your browser or leave the page?
 That's ok. Once saved, all your notes will be 
 right where you left them when you come back.
